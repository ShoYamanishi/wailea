@article{BL76,
	Abstract = {A data structure called a PQ-tree is introduced. PQ-trees can be used to represent the permutations of a set U in which various subsets of U occur consecutively. Efficient algorithms are presented for manipulating PQ-trees. Algorithms using PQ-trees are then given which test for the consecutive ones property in matrices and for graph planarity. The consecutive ones test is extended to a test for interval graphs using a recently discovered fast recognition algorithm for chordal graphs. All of these algorithms require a number of steps linear in the size of their input.},
